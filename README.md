# AVR-ISP-Programmer-Board
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a small, easy to use printed circuit board for programming
an ATmega328p microcontroller.

## Requirements
The board must meet the following requirements
* Have a socket allowing for the placement and removal of the microcontroller
* Have a connector allowing the direct use of the Waveshare USB AVRISP XPII programmer
* Have a connector to provide power to the microcontroller and programmer
* Not require any wires or jumpers other than those listed as required
* Be small
* Be easy to assemble

## Resources

### Software
The KiCad printed circuit board software suite will be used to design the circuit board.

### Equipment
A soldering iron (and solder) is required to build to board.

### Manufacturing
OSH Park will be used to manufacture the board.
